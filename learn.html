        <div class="subtext">
            We came up with the idea of this group since we had to face a lot of problems and 
            difficulties during our first experience with the stock market and trading strategies, 
            we used to search all over the internet just to gather even a small piece of information, 
            There was no authentic sharing and learning platform for this purpose of our campus hence we decided to create one.! 
            We also have certain things planned across the timeline such as Daily current affairs about the market, 
            monthly company analysis, study materials, articles about market changes, risk management strategies, 
            algorithmic strategies, career opportunities in the stock market etc.
